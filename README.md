# Regular Expressions Learning Journey

During my training period, I delved into the world of regular expressions (regex), learning how to manipulate text efficiently. Regex proved to be a powerful tool for various tasks such as validating user inputs and parsing log files.

## What I Learned

- **Basics of Regex**: Understanding the fundamentals of regex syntax and patterns.
- **Application in Real-world Tasks**: Using regex for practical tasks like data validation and extraction.
- **Problem-solving Skills**: Enhancing my ability to tackle complex text manipulation challenges.
- **Efficient Coding**: Learning to write concise and effective regex expressions for different tasks.

## Regex Format (Groovy)

In Groovy, a basic format for a regular expression can be represented as follows:

```groovy
def regexPattern = ~/your_regex_pattern_here/
